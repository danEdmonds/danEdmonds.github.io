                <h2>Vehicle and Engine Testing Laboratory (VETL)</h2>
                <p>The VETL is a 20,000-square foot, off-campus facility focused on providing industry with testing and evaluation services. Our four chassis dynamometers are capable of measuring raw and dilute emissions from vehicles ranging from 200 - 80,000 lbs. GVWR. Two transient motoring engine dynamometer test cells with full-flow CVS and raw emissions capabilities are available to test engines powered by many different types of fuels (i.e., gasoline, diesel, bio-diesel natural gas, methanol). Regulated emissions from these tests are measured following the 40 CFR Part 1065/1066 and Part 86.</p>

                <h2>Advanced Combustion Laboratory (ACL)</h2>
                <p>CAFEE’s ACL is directed toward increasing the understanding of fundamental combustion processes in power-generation applications. Specifically, the ACL will investigate the interaction between the power-generating systems, the combustion strategy, and the composition and property of the fuel.</p>

                <h2>Engines and Emissions Research Laboratory (EERL)</h2>
                <p>The EERL supports research on developing technologies for internal combustion engines fueled from diesel or natural gas ranging from 10 - 800 hp. This laboratory is capable of measuring raw and dilute emissions, in addition to customizable engine instrumentation and combustion analysis for a wide range of engines and fuels.</p>

                <h2>Transportable/Portable Emissions Measurement System (TEMS/PEMS)</h2>
                <p>Our portable emissions measurement laboratories are capable of characterizing performance and emissions from a wide variety of vehicles and engines from both on-highway and non-road sectors. Our two fully transportable chassis dynamometers are capable of testing vehicles ranging from 5,000 – 80,000 lbs. GVWR. Full-flow transportable CVS that can be used in conjunction with a chassis or used independently, connected to a trailing vehicle, is available to assess the performance and emissions of vehicles at virtually any location in North America.</p>

                <h2>Locomotive Emissions Testing Facility</h2>
                <p>Located at the Norfolk Southern Juniata Locomotive Shop in Altoona, Pennsylvania, this facility is owned by Norfolk Southern Corporation and operated by a joint partnership between Norfolk Southern and CAFEE.</p>

                <h2>Subsonic Environmental Wind Tunnel</h2>
                <p>Located near nearby Arthurdale, CAFEE conducts particle characterization research using our subsonic environmental wind tunnel, which allows our researchers to conduct studies such as soot imaging (SEM and AFM), health effect studies, and particulate matter plume studies</p>
