        <h1>About WVU CAFEE</h1>

        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-sm-8">

                <p>For nearly 30 years, WVU’s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines, and Emission has been a worldwide leader in the measurement and control of heavy-duty mobile source exhaust emissions and alternative fuels research.</p>
                <p>From engineering the world’s first transportable emissions testing laboratory through a steady growth that has seen it excel in the engine, chassis, field and laboratory testing, and nearly every space in the automotive spectrum, WVU CAFEE has matured from a business operating within academia into a comprehensive organization with world-class research, test and evaluation capabilities.</p>
                <p>CAFEE’s student researchers remain a crucial component to our success and unique story, and as graduates they continue to play leading roles in automotive research and development across the globe.</p>

                <h2>The CAFEE Value</h2>
                <p>At CAFEE, we can execute industry standards, but also achieve success by providing flexible, client-centric testing needs. Through student engagement, industry objectivity, and the ability to provide services from concept through development, demonstration, and deployment, CAFEE delivers value that few other companies in this industry can claim.</p>

                <h2>Our Focus</h2>
                <p>Our years of research, development, and overall experience have put us in a unique position to develop long-standing relationships with industry giants and non-governmental organizations, as well as state, federal, and international governments. These alliances showcase our flexibility by demonstrating that we can meet any entity’s needs, whether big or small, public or private, national or international.</p>
                <p>At CAFEE, our focus is on our customers -- whether they’re manufacturers, government agencies, watchdog groups, or any type of client – and our team take pride in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing IP and helping industry to transition market technologies for commercialization</li>
                    <li>Maintaining export control compliance for secure delivery of data and client-related technologies</li>
                    <li>Delivering client-oriented testing and development needs at the highest level possible</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why CAFEE Is Unique</h2>
                <p>WVU CAFEE is a different kind of emissions research center – and here are a few reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We’re the pioneers of portable and mobile emissions measurement research and testing</li>
                    <li>We conduct objective research and testing providing data to all stakeholders - OEM, Trade Associations, Regulatory Agencies, NGOs and Tier Suppliers</li>
                    <li>We built the world’s first mobile and heavy-duty chassis dynamometer and mobile CVS emissions laboratory</li>
                    <li>We’ve got a long-standing history in vehicle and engine operation characterization and “road to laboratory” performance qualification</li>
                    <li>We’ve got a unique value proposition of traditional academic environment merged with state-of-the-industry testing and evaluation capabilities</li>
                    <li>We’re built the world’s largest national database of heavy-duty vehicle exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency data</li>
                    <li>We feature a large pool of WVU undergraduate and graduate engineering students, the workforce of the future. Our students learn and perfect their skills firsthand and are employer-ready upon graduation.</li>
                </ul>
