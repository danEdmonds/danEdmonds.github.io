{"name":"Dan Edmonds","tagline":"","body":"###hi, i'm dan edmonds.\r\nI'm a passionate user interface designer and front-end developer residing just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I specialize in WordPress development and I'm currently the Interactive Developer at PMI.\r\n\r\nI love crafting beautiful and intuitive design solutions with an emphasis on simplicity, usability, and accessibility. My admiration for web standards is perfectly complemented by executing clean, hand-coded mark-up to build responsive, optimized, cross-browser compatible sites.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not behind my MacBook Pro, you'll find me spending time with my fianc√©e, watching Pixar films or hockey, or speeding on a winding back road in my little slice of Europe.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
