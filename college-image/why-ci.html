			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>It’s been said a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>

But Forrester Research estimates one minute of video is worth 1.8 million words.

Video today is a major component of any progressive college’s recruitment toolkit, as students,

parents, alumni, and donors prefer the excitement, comprehensiveness, and inspiration that

comes with an expertly-created visual production.

The days of the standard college viewbook are over.

A College Image video today allows your institution to:

<ul>
    <li>Showcase your campus and its many visual features</li>
    <li>Explain in compelling fashion the benefits of your institution</li>
    <li>See and hear testimonials from students, professors, and campus leaders</li>
    <li>Present an abundance of information in a way that’s fun and easy to watch</li>
    <li>Make a lasting impression on the audiences you most desire</li>
</ul>

A single College Image video can be multipurposed in a myriad of ways, from YouTube,

Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, social media sites, your institution’s websites, and in

countless more digital forms.

Your video is easily distributed worldwide to potential students or education professionals

assisting others with future academic plans. It can be emailed directly to the inboxes of possible

donors.

Studies consistently show amazing consumer reaction to well-crafted higher education

promotional videos as compared to other forms of advertising.

Today, a remarkable 80% of web users recall watching a video on a website they visited in the
