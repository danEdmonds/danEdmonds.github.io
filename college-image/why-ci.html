				<h1>Why CI</h1>
				<p>It’s been said a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
				<p>But Forrester Research estimates <a href="http://www.videobrewery.com/blog/18-video-marketing-statistics">one minute of video is worth 1.8 million words</a>.</p>
				<p>Video today is a major component of any progressive college’s recruitment toolkit, as students, parents, alumni, and donors prefer the excitement, comprehensiveness, and inspiration that comes with an expertly-created visual production.</p>
				<p>The days of the standard college viewbook are over.</p>
				<p>A College Image video today allows your institution to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Showcase your campus and its many visual features</li>
					<li>Explain in compelling fashion the benefits of your institution</li>
					<li>See and hear testimonials from students, professors, and campus leaders</li>
					<li>Present an abundance of information in a way that’s fun and easy to watch</li>
					<li>Make a lasting impression on the audiences you most desire</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A single College Image video can be multipurposed in a myriad of ways, from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, social media sites, your institution’s websites, and in countless more digital forms.</p>
				<p>Your video is easily distributed worldwide to potential students or education professionals assisting others with future academic plans. It can be emailed directly to the inboxes of possible donors.</p>
				<p>Studies consistently show amazing consumer reaction to well-crafted higher education promotional videos as compared to other forms of advertising.</p>
				<p>Today, a remarkable 80% of web users recall watching a video on a website they visited in the past 30 days, according to the Online Publishers Association.</p>
				<p>And of those people who watch your video:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>26% look for more information about the subject</li>
					<li>22% visit the website referred to in the video</li>
					<li>15% make an appointment with the institution profiled</li>
					<li>12% purchase the product featured</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Your college deserves to make a lasting impression.</p>
				<p>College Image is video creation for higher education.</p>
